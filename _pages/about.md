I am a PhD student in Mechanics at at <a href='http://www.dalembert.upmc.fr/ijlrda/'>l'Institut Jean Le Rond d'Alembert</a>, <a href='https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/'>Sorbonne University</a>.

My PhD research focuses on elasto-capillary interactions, exploring how elasticity and capillarity interplay in mechanical systems. Additionally, I study structural mechanics, analyzing instabilities and nonlinear behaviors using theoretical modeling and numerical analysis.

My methods are deeply connected to optimization, stability analysis, and bifurcation theory. Since the beginning of my PhD, I have developed extensive expertise in numerical simulations and coding. While my primary focus is on theoretical modeling, I remain open to experimental work when needed.

Looking ahead, I aim to further explore elasto-capillary interactions from a fluid mechanics perspective, as well as study other instability problems and the mechanics of soft materials. I am particularly interested in advancing theoretical modeling and numerical analysis to gain deeper insights into these complex mechanical phenomena.
