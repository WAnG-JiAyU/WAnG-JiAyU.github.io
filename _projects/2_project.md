            Here we study a pending drop, attached to a substrat with fixed radius. The results are obtained by minimising the total energy of the system using optimiser <a href='https://casadi.org/'>CasADi</a>.

        Here are two diagrams of different variables in the case that the substrate radius is fixed at 2.5 and we vary the volume of the drop. Different colors indicating different stability index (0: stable, 1<: unstable).
